# Note Taker (Module 11 Homework - Express)

The goal was to create a note taking application so that the user can keep themself organized. The requirements were:
  - Present a landing page with a link to a notes page.
  - The link to the notes page presents a page with existing notes and empty fields that can be used to enter a new note
  - When a title and body are created for a note, a Save icon appears in the navigation bar
  - Clicking the Save button saves the new note to the existing notes column
  - Existing notes can be clicked on to display in the column on the right
  - Clicking the Write (plus) icon presents empty fields to enter a new note
  - The delete button on an existing note allows the user to delete the note
